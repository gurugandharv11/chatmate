Objectives
Create and configure Servlets.
Implement doGet and doPost methods in Servlets.
Develop a user form registration and profile system using Servlets.
Integrate JSP with Servlets.
Implement JSP pages for displaying user data.
Utilize JSTL (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library) and EL (Expression Language) in JSP pages.
Project Setup
Prerequisites
JDK 8 or later
Apache Tomcat server
IDE with Java EE support (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA)
Maven (optional)
Installation
Clone the repository.
Configure the Tomcat server in your IDE.
Build and deploy the project to the server.
Implementation Details
1. Create and Configure Servlets
Write Servlets using the HttpServlet class.
Add necessary @WebServlet annotations or configure the Servlets in web.xml.
2. Implement doGet and doPost
Implement the doGet method for handling HTTP GET requests (e.g., fetching data).
Implement the doPost method for processing form submissions (e.g., saving user data).
3. User Form Registration and Profile
Create an HTML/JSP form for user registration.
Use a Servlet to handle form data submission, validate inputs, and save the profile details.
4. Integrate JSP with Servlets
Forward requests from Servlets to JSP for dynamic content generation using RequestDispatcher.
5. JSP Pages for Displaying User Data
Create JSP pages to render user profile data dynamically.
Pass data from the Servlet to JSP using request attributes.
6. Use JSTL and EL in JSP
Leverage JSTL for iterating over collections and displaying data.
Use EL for accessing attributes and expressions directly in JSP.
Example File Structure
Usage
Access the user registration form at <server-url>/userForm.
Fill in the form and submit to save the data.
View user details on the profile page.
