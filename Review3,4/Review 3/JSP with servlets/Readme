This project demonstrates how to integrate JSP (Java Server Pages) with Servlets to create a web application that handles user registration and profile display. The application uses JSP for the front-end views and Servlets for business logic, ensuring a clean separation between the presentation and logic layers.

Features
User Registration: Collects user details (name, email, age) via a registration form.
User Profile Display: Shows the user’s profile after successful registration.
Servlets: Handles form data processing and session management.
JSP: Displays dynamic content using JSTL and EL.
Technologies Used
Java Servlets: Manages business logic and session data.
JSP (Java Server Pages): Renders dynamic HTML pages.
JSTL: For control structures like loops and conditions in JSP.
EL (Expression Language): To access session and request data directly in JSP.

Setup and Usage
Required Software:

JDK: Java Development Kit (8 or above).
Servlet Container: Apache Tomcat or similar.
JSTL Library: Include jstl.jar and standard.jar in the WEB-INF/lib directory.
Deploying the Application:

Compile and deploy the project to a servlet container like Tomcat.
Access the application via http://localhost:8080/your-app-name.
Navigating the Application:

Registration: Fill out the form on the registration page (registration.jsp).
Profile View: After registration, the user can view their profile on profile.jsp.
How It Works
Servlets:

UserRegistrationServlet: Processes the registration form and stores user data in the session.
UserProfileServlet: Fetches user data from the session and forwards to the profile.jsp.
JSP Pages:

registration.jsp: Displays the registration form and submits the data to the servlet.
profile.jsp: Uses JSTL and EL to display the user’s profile from session attributes.
Future Enhancements
Persistent Storage: Store user data in a database like MySQL.
Form Validation: Add client-side and server-side validation.
