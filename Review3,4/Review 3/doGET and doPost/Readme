1. doGet Method
Purpose: Handles GET requests (e.g., when a user visits the /chat URL in a browser).
Implementation:
Set the content type to text/html.
Return a simple HTML page with a form for sending messages.
This form submits a POST request to the same servlet. 


2. doPost Method
Purpose: Handles POST requests (e.g., when the form is submitted or a message is sent via AJAX).
Implementation:
Extract the user's message using request.getParameter("message").
Generate a bot response based on the input (this can be expanded with more complex logic).
Set the content type to application/json to return the response in JSON format.
Write the JSON response, ensuring proper formatting.
Example Interaction
GET Request:
Visiting http://localhost:8080/chat displays the HTML page with a form.
POST Request:
Submitting the form or sending a POST request programmatically (e.g., using JavaScript's fetch) triggers the doPost method.
The servlet responds with a JSON object containing the bot's message.
